For thirty years, the rhythmic sweep of light had been his only companion, save for the gulls and the occasional storm. Tonight, however, felt different. A soft, pulsating luminescence drew his eye to a forgotten chest tucked away in the storage room. Inside, nestled amongst brittle charts, lay a map unlike any he’d seen. It wasn't parchment, but something akin to woven moonlight. Strange symbols pulsed with an inner glow, shifting and rearranging themselves. Elias traced a shimmering line that seemed to point not to a coastline, but to the star-dusted expanse beyond. His heart, usually as steady as the tide, began to race. The sea was vast, but perhaps, so was the sky.\nCriticAgent > 1. **Plot:** The plot is intriguing but feels like the very beginning of a larger story. The discovery of the map is a compelling hook, but it leaves the reader wanting to know what Elias does next and what the map leads to. Consider adding a sentence or two that hints at Elias's decision or a first action he takes based on the map.\n2. **Character:** Elias is established as a solitary and routine-driven individual. This is effective. However, to deepen his character, explore his internal reaction to this extraordinary discovery beyond his racing heart. What are his initial thoughts, fears, or aspirations? Does this discovery awaken a long-dormant curiosity or a sense of destiny?\n3. **Pacing:** The pacing is good for setting the scene and introducing the mystery. The initial description of Elias's life builds a sense of quiet anticipation, and the discovery of the map is well-timed. However, the ending feels a bit abrupt. The story ends on a thought, leaving the reader hanging. Consider extending it slightly to show Elias taking a more active role in exploring the map's implications.\nRefinerAgent > Elias polished the great lens, the familiar scent of oil and salt filling his small world. For thirty years, the rhythmic sweep of light had been his only companion, save for the gulls and the occasional storm. Tonight, however, felt different. A soft, pulsating luminescence drew his eye to a forgotten chest tucked away in the storage room. Inside, nestled amongst brittle charts, lay a map unlike any he’d seen. It wasn't parchment, but something akin to woven moonlight. Strange symbols pulsed with an inner glow, shifting and rearranging themselves. Elias traced a shimmering line that seemed to point not to a coastline, but to the star-dusted expanse beyond. His heart, usually as steady as the tide, began to race. A lifetime of predictable horizons shattered, replaced by a dizzying sense of possibility. Was this a jest of the sea, or an invitation? A long-dormant ember of youthful curiosity, long buried under decades of routine, flared within him. He felt a tremor of fear, not of the unknown, but of the mundane life he might return to if he ignored this. Clutching the celestial chart, Elias carefully folded it, the woven moonlight cool against his weathered fingers. He would not simply chart stars; he would learn to navigate them. His first act would be to compare the map's constellations with his own worn almanac, to find the earthly anchor for this ethereal guide. The sea was vast, but perhaps, so was the sky, and for the first time in thirty years, Elias felt an urge to explore beyond his solitary tower.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
