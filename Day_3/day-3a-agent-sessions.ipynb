It's one of the most impactful areas where AI is transforming healthcare. Here are some of the key recent trends and breakthroughs:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n*   **Creating Entirely New Molecules:** Instead of just screening existing libraries, generative AI models (like those based on GANs or diffusion models) can now design entirely novel molecular structures with desired properties. This opens up possibilities for targeting previously \"undruggable\" proteins or creating molecules with unique mechanisms of action.\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** AI is used to generate molecules from scratch, guided by specific targets, desired pharmacokinetic properties (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted), and even toxicity profiles.\n\n**2.

They focus heavily on generative AI for novel molecule design.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning to predict how small molecules will bind to target proteins, accelerating the identification of potential drug candidates.\n*   **Exscientia:** Another leader in AI-driven drug discovery, with multiple AI-designed molecules progressing through clinical trials.\n*   **NVIDIA Clara Discovery:** Provides AI tools and platforms that researchers can leverage for various stages of drug discovery, from target identification to molecular simulation.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advances, challenges persist:\n\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still require rigorous experimental validation.\n*   **Data Quality and Access:** The effectiveness of AI heavily relies on the quality and availability of diverse biological and clinical data.\n*   **Regulatory Pathways:** Navigating regulatory approval for AI-discovered drugs is an evolving process.\n*   **Interpretability:** While progress is being made, understanding *why* an AI model makes certain predictions can still be a challenge.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just optimizing existing drug discovery processes; it's fundamentally changing how new medicines are conceived and developed, promising to bring more effective and personalized treatments to patients faster than ever before.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned in the context of AI in drug discovery: **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity with Higher Accuracy**. This is a critical area because it directly impacts the speed and success rate of bringing new drugs to market.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into this development:\n\n**The Core Problem AI Addresses:**\n\nTraditionally, determining if a drug candidate is effective and safe involves a long, expensive, and often unsuccessful pipeline.\n*   **Efficacy:** You need to see if the drug actually works against the disease target and has the desired therapeutic effect in biological systems.\n*   **Toxicity:** You need to identify potential harmful side effects that could emerge during preclinical testing (in cells, animal models) and, critically, in human clinical trials.\n\nMany promising drug candidates fail at later stages due to insufficient efficacy or unforeseen toxicity, wasting years of research and billions of dollars.\n\n**How AI Improves Prediction:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning, excels at identifying complex patterns within vast datasets that are often invisible to human analysis. Here's how it applies to predicting efficacy and toxicity:\n\n1.  **In Silico Screening and Virtual Screening:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** AI models are trained on historical data of known drug-target interactions, their observed efficacy, and their reported toxicities. They can then predict the likelihood of a new molecule binding to its intended target and eliciting a desired biological response.\n    *   **Benefit:** This allows researchers to rapidly screen millions of potential compounds virtually, prioritizing only the most promising ones for experimental testing. This dramatically reduces the number of compounds that need to be synthesized and tested in the lab.\n\n2.  **Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) Models:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** These AI models correlate the chemical structure of a molecule with its biological activity (e.g., efficacy) or its physical/chemical properties (e.g., solubility, permeability, metabolic stability, which influence efficacy and toxicity).\n    *   **Benefit:** Researchers can design molecules with a higher probability of having the desired activity and favorable ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) profiles from the outset.\n\n3.  **Predicting Off-Target Effects and Toxicity Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** AI can analyze a molecule's structure and predict its potential interactions with unintended biological targets (off-target effects) that could lead to adverse reactions. Advanced models can even predict specific toxicity pathways (e.g., cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity).\n    *   **Benefit:** This allows for the early identification and mitigation of potential safety issues, preventing candidates from progressing that are likely to fail due to toxicity.\n\n4.  **Leveraging Multi-modal and Real-World Data:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is where the \"Multi-modal Data Integration\" aspect comes in. AI models are increasingly incorporating:\n        *   **Genomic and Proteomic Data:** Understanding how a drug interacts with an individual's specific genetic makeup or protein landscape.\n        *   **Clinical Trial Data:** Analyzing vast historical clinical trial outcomes to identify predictors of success or failure.\n        *   **Scientific Literature:** Extracting insights from millions of published research papers.\n        *   **Real-World Evidence (RWE):** Data from electronic health records, insurance claims, and patient registries to understand how drugs perform in actual patient populations after approval.\n    *   **Benefit:** This holistic approach leads to more robust and accurate predictions by considering a wider range of factors influencing a drug's behavior.\n\n**Impact and Significance:**\n\n*   **Reduced Failure Rates:** By weeding out less promising candidates earlier, AI helps reduce the high attrition rates in drug discovery.\n*   **Faster Timelines:** Virtual screening and predictive modeling significantly shorten the time it takes to move from initial compound identification to preclinical and clinical stages.\n*   **Cost Savings:** Fewer failed experiments and shorter development cycles translate into substantial cost reductions.\n*   **Improved Patient Safety:** Early identification of potential toxicities leads to safer drug candidates entering human trials.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   Many AI drug discovery companies have internal platforms that boast high accuracy in predicting binding affinity, ADMET properties, and even disease response.\n*   Some AI models are being developed to predict the likelihood of specific adverse events in clinical trials based on preclinical data.\n\nIn essence, AI's ability to analyze complex biological and chemical data at scale allows for a much more intelligent and predictive approach to drug development, moving away from trial-and-error towards a more data-driven and rational design process.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Several types of companies are heavily involved in using AI to predict drug efficacy and toxicity, ranging from large pharmaceutical giants to specialized AI biotech firms.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
